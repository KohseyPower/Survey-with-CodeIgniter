This is a project I realized during my first year of CS class.
It's a website that lets you organize meetings (a bit like Doodle).
You can create surveys and a schedule list. The website will generate a link where people can indicate their availability.
The site is functional, but there are still few things to be fixed. I will gradually update it.
